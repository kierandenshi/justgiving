### Just Giving programmer test

This solution has been completed as though it were part of a bigger application. This app could have been created with a much simpler stack, but the tooling has been emphasised as implied in the test instructions. React, Redux, Redux Saga forms the basis for the application. Build is with Webpack, which is using Babel and Sass transformers.

#### To install

Git clone and then
`npm install` or `yarn`

#### To run locally

Start the Webpack dev server with `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`. The server will listen on port 4040.

#### To run tests

There is basic test coverage for state reducers, containers and components. Test use Mocha with Chai and Sinon assertions. Run the tests with `npm run test` or `yarn run test`.

#### To build

A distributable package can be created with `npm run build` or `yarn run build`.
